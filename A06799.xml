            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Inſomuch, that many times we ſhake, and are afraid at the onely mention thereof. Verily,
<pb facs="tcp:27857:6"/>
the nature of man being ſuch as had rather not be at all, then to be ill appaied, or to be in miſerie, cannot whenſoeuer theſe things befall, but be much vexed and perplexed, yea and ſometimes readie to faint: And yet behold the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and death of the ſoule farre more dreadfull, and more horrible; then which can befall vnto a man, no greater miſerie and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is no man, but he doth feare and abhorre, yea and by all meanes flie from corporal puniſhments and afflictions, and from corporall ſickneſſes and

and chearfully offer vp thy body as a ſacrifice to God, and faſten it with Chriſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Croſſe. This ſicknes of thine is therefore a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſement, not ſent for thy hurt, or for thy deſtruction, but for thy great good, to the end that thereby thou mayſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, yea quickned and reſtored (as it were) to life againe. God thy heauenly Father ſeeth perhaps, thy old <hi>Adam</hi> (that is, thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature) too luſtie and vnruly, and too froward and ſtubborne, to wax wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and proud, and vnable to bridle and ouerſway his luſts; and that while he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth too too much his own deſires and affections,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:27857:100"/>
he cannot reſtraine himſelf, nor moderate and keepe himſelfe in any good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and therefore he doth ſhut him vp (as it were) in this priſon, and he bindeth him (as it were) with theſe fetters and chaines of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſickneſſe, thereby to bridle, repreſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him, leſt he ſhould bring the moſt noble and precious ſoule in danger to be ſeduced. Fleſh &amp; blood doth reigne ſtill, and beare the ſway in thee more then the Spirit. Here therefore, behold, God is preſent with thy Spirit, ayding and ſtrengthening the ſame, while it wraſtleth againſt the rebellious and vnruly fleſh; that hauing vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:27857:101"/>
the ſame, it may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it and keepe it vnder. It may be, that if now at this time thou were in health and proſperitie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thy fleſh (as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies inclined to nothing, but euill) hauing deceiued thee, it would driue thee and caſt thee headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many dangerous ſinnes againſt thy God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the wrath of God ſhold be prouoked, and a way prepared for thy ſoule vnto hell fire and damnation. Now behold thy heauenly Father, preuenting this loſſe and danger, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding better for thee, and for thy welfare and ſafetie; he reſtraineth and holdeth backe (as it were with a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27857:101"/>
this fleſh of thine, which with tooth &amp; naile, and with al her ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belleth againſt the Spirit, and hauing taken it cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue (as it were) he reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame, that it tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not into a ſinke of ſins; but rather may be ſubdued, and brought in obedience vnto the Spirit. Now, ſith this is the good will and pleaſure of thy heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who doth all this in tender loue vnto thee, and fith that all this tendeth to thy profite and welfare: take heed in any wiſe that thou ſtriue not, nor oppoſe thy ſelfe againſt the ſame. But rather ſuffer patiently, and pray that thy heauenly Fathers wil may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed

and fulfilled; that he will intreate thee, and deale with thee according to his good pleaſure; that thou will and deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which ſhall ſeeme good vnto him; that all things may tend to the glorie and praiſe of God; and that his grace may ſtill be preſent with thee, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thee to beare meekely and patiently the Croſſe &amp; affliction that lyeth vpon thee. <hi>For patience bringeth forth experience, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi>

But when thou haſt learned the ſame before by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and haſt now already
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:27857:103"/>
ſome taſte therof, thy mind is not daunted, nor ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with any croſſes or afflictions: but thy hope &amp; confidence is ſtill more and more increaſed, when as once and againe thou haſt had experience of the helpe of God ſtill preſent with thee. And if God (through a certaine conniuency) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee ſometimes to bee plunged, and to ſticke faſt in the mire (as it were) for a time: yet notwithſtanding at the length he will reach out his helping hand, to ſaue and deliuer thee.

In afflictions therefore thou learneſt to conceiue, and cheriſh within thy ſelfe a certaine and vndoubted hope &amp; confidence in God. So as in farre greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diſtreſſes (when as no help appeareth from elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) thou mayſt boldlie put truſt and confidence in him: (being already taught and aſſured of his vſual and ordinarie manner, in ſauing &amp; deliuering his children.) Thou haſt learned, that ſickneſſes, and other croſſes and afflictions, are ſent not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:27857:104"/>

Neither art thou diſcouraged, but ſtedfaſtly hopeſt, that at the length hee will ſend thee help and deliuerance, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he deferreth long, &amp; hideth his face, making as if hee heard not. And ſo at length thou vnderſtandeſt well, and acknowledgeſt, that thy greefe and ſicknes is not ſent vnto thee for thy hurt or perdition, but for the glorie of God, and for thine own eternall welfare and ſaluation.

                  <p>Now then, foraſmuch as God hath a fauor vnto thee, and will be a Father vnto thee, and conſequently will neuer forſake thee: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as thou haſt ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible a ſigne and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thereof, thou oughteſt to commit and giue ouer, both all thy affaires and thy ſelfe alſo wholly vnto him, to obey his will, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer patiently his hand vpon thee (whether it be his will that thou liue or die) pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſiring that his good will may be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his praiſe and glory. And it is vnpoſſible if thou truſt ſtedfaſtly in Gods mercie
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:27857:107"/>
promiſed through Chriſt, and thus dedicate thy ſelfe wholly vnto him: it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible (I ſay) that thou ſhouldeſt periſh or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Foraſmuch as God hath promiſed, that he will be thy Father, euen the ſame God, who is moſt true of his word, yea truth it ſelfe; while thou doeſt beleeue &amp; acknowledge him ſo to be, and thereupon hopeſt and lookeſt for all good things from him; he cannot, but (as a tender Father) take care of thee, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in good time ſaue and deliuer thee (how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoeuer for the preſent he may ſeeme to intreate thee) yea foraſmuch as he hath promiſed to be a Father not

onely vnto thee, but alſo vnto thy ſeede after thee, &amp; thou ſtedfaſtly beleeueſt theſe his promiſes: he will without all doubt haue a diligent and prouident care both of thee and thine. And therefore mayeſt thou well recommend vnto him, not onely thy bodie and ſoule, but alſo thy wife and thy children, thy kinsfolke and thy friends, and briefly all that thou haſt belonging vnto thee. Nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but that he will be a true Father vnto thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a true husband vnto thy wife, and a true friend vnto thy kinsfolke and friends. For God hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto vſed thee in theſe, &amp; toward theſe, onely as a Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:27857:108"/>
And now when he will haue thee to leaue the execution of this office and charge, he will doubtleſſe ſubſtitute in thy ſtead ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Steward ouer them, who ſhall faithfully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently take care of them. If with full confidence of heart, thou ſhalt hope and looke for this from him, there is no doubt but that he will do it (as I haue ſaid.) Wherefore ſhake off from thee, and caſt out of thy mind al care for thy friends, and for all thy worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; and commit the ſame ouer vnto God.

                  <p>And now, whereas God hath freely for Chriſt his ſake pardoned and forgiuen thee all thy ſinnes: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nothing elſe of thee for this infinite and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefite; but that thou in like manner from thy very heart forgiue all thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue done wrong and iniury vnto thee.

Now if thou haſt thy mind thus voide and free from inward grudge, malice and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, thou haſt alſo an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſigne, that God hath pardoned thee all thy ſinnes, &amp; vtterly raſed them out of his ſight.

thy old man might be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and ouercome, repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and kept vnder, yea mortified and put to death (as it were) that ſo at length it may ceaſſe to offend.

others, as long as (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our firſt birth,) this fleſh ſtill remaineth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?<note place="margin">In fleſh we are all one like another, but are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in ſpirit.</note> So long as we are heere in this world, we are knit and ioyned together with all other men alike, and are all one in fleſh, but are ſeuered in ſpirit.

And ſo is a ſouldier not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in a ſharpe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous warre. It is but a nice and vaine brag of men, to vant themſelues of what they haue done, when there hath bene no danger at all. But for a man to encounter manfully in time of trouble and aduerſitie, is the right triall of the truth. The tree y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is deepely rooted (though the winds blow vpon it with neuer ſo great force &amp; violence) yet it is not moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at all: and the ſhippe which is ſtrongly ioynted (though the waues beate vpon it neuer ſo faſt) yet is it not pierced through.

the body) to be cut off; and that by reaſon of feeblenes, proceeding of ſome hurt of the bodie, the going is weakned, or the hearing is ſtopped, or the ſight is darkned: all this is good for vs, and profitable for the triall of our faith.

and other enemies of Chriſt; ſo to the ſeruants of God it is a comfortable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and behouefull for their welfare and ſaluation.

For behold, the righteous are called hence vnto eaſe and reſt; and the wicked are haled and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away vnto endleſſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and torment.

Make him with earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, with ſtedfaſt aſſurance and faith vnfained, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſo great a treaſure of happineſſe, (to wit, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all his ſinnes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Chriſt Ieſus, and for his ſake) which by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery

of the word, and by the participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments hath heretofore beene exhibited and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him: that ſo it may be a comfort, a fortreſſe, &amp; ſure refuge againſt the feare and trouble of his accuſing conſcience, and againſt all the ſubtile ſleights and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the Diuel. Yea let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame his faith be vnto him an armour of proofe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may repell and beate backe all the fierie darts of the wicked, &amp; ſo may ſafely paſſe euen through death vnto life; which hauing once attained, he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the perfect fruition thereof for euermore. We therefore wholly commend him vnto thee (O heauenly
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:27857:164"/>
Father,) and inaſmuch as he is ſo grieuouſly ſicke and diſeaſed, be thou his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cure and heale him. Foraſmuch as he is weake and feeble, confirme thou and ſtrengthen him. Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is deſtitute and void of worldly help, ſend aide (we beſeech thee) and in due time releeue and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour him. Foraſmuch as he lieth thus deiected and caſt downe, raiſe thou him vp againe. Foraſmuch as he is thus wounded, binde thou vp his wounds. Foraſmuch as he is ſo fearefull and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, giue him O Lord, boldneſſe and courage. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his manifold ſins and corruptions, waſh him and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:27857:165"/>
cleanſe him from them all, in the blood of thy Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, that immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Lamb. Yea for as much as thou knoweſt all things whereof he ſtandeth in need, and (according to thy good pleaſure canſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the ſame; ſatisfie (we beſeech thee, O gracious Father) his lawful and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires; ſatisfie his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hunger and thirſt; yea ſatisfie him him abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thy truth, and with thy ſaluation. Receiue and embrace him (for he flyeth only vnto thee for ſuccour.) Accept him therefore, and make him conſtant &amp; ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in all things to obey, and to doe thy will. Finally, we pray thee of thine infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:27857:165"/>
goodneſſe and mercie, to pardon and forgiue all thoſe ſinnes, whereby he hath prouoked againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thy fierce wrath and diſpleaſure. In ſtead of death, and after death, grant vnto him life, euen life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting; that he may for euer liue with thee in glory. And if thou thinke it better &amp; more expedient for him, that he abide yet longer in this mortalitie; either for the benefit of others, and for the vſe and ſeruice of the Church, or elſe for his owne behalfe and benefite, that he may more nearely be conformed and made like vnto the example and image of thy Sonne Chriſt Ieſus: reſtore vnto him
